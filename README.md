printf Project

Description

This project forms an integral part of the ALX curriculum, wherein we embark on crafting our own version of the printf function using the C programming language. As many are aware, the printf function is a crucial component of the C standard library, serving the purpose of displaying formatted output on the console.

The primary objectives of this undertaking are twofold. Firstly, it aims to provide us with an in-depth comprehension of the internal mechanics behind the printf function. Secondly, it allows us to hone our abilities in working with variadic functions and handling extensive codebases. By accomplishing this project, we can further elevate our programming skills and foster a deeper appreciation for the underlying principles of printf and similar functions.

Tasks

The printf project is broken down into several tasks, each of which focuses on a specific aspect of the printf function. Here's a brief overview of the tasks that are involved in this project:

Task 0
Write a function that produces output according to format. This task involves implementing the basic functionality of printf, and it handles conversion specifiers c and s.

Task 1
Handle conversion specifiers d and i. This task involves adding support for integer conversion specifiers to the printf function.

Task 2
Create a man page for the function. This task involves writing a manual page that documents the usage and functionality of the printf function.

Task 3
Handle conversion specifier b. This task involves adding support for binary conversion specifiers to the printf function.

Task 4
Handle conversion specifiers u, o, x, and X. This task involves adding support for unsigned integer, octal, and hexadecimal conversion specifiers to the printf function.

Task 5
Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible. This task involves optimizing the printf function to minimize the number of calls to the write function, which can improve performance.

Task 6
Handle custom conversion specifier %S. This task involves adding support for a custom conversion specifier that prints non-printable characters in a specific format.

Task 7
Handle conversion specifier p. This task involves adding support for pointer address conversion specifiers to the printf function.

Task 8
Handle flag characters +, space, and #. This task involves adding support for flag characters that modify the formatting of the output.

Task 9
Handle length modifiers l and h. This task involves adding support for length modifiers that change the size of the data types that are printed by the printf function.

Task 10
Handle field width. This task involves adding support for specifying a minimum field width for the output.

Task 11
Handle precision. This task involves adding support for specifying the precision of floating point numbers that are printed by the printf function.

Task 12
Handle flag character 0. This task involves adding support for a flag character that pads the output with zeros.

Task 13
Handle flag character -. This task involves adding support for a flag character that left-aligns the output.

Task 14
Handle custom conversion specifier %r. This task involves adding support for a custom conversion specifier that prints reversed strings.

Task 15
Handle custom conversion specifier %R. This task involves adding support for a custom conversion specifier that applies the rot13 encryption algorithm to strings.

Task 16
All the above options work well together. This task involves testing the printf function to ensure that all of the implemented features work correctly and that there are no conflicts between them.
